In this paper, the authors explore the characteristics of cloud storage, and developed AnyBlob which using io_uring to improve throughput and saturate network bandwidth. They used Umbra with different configuration to do the experiments on TPC-H benchmark.

- **Strengths**: achieving high bandwidth data processing; using io_uring to saturate network bandwidth

- **Future works**: can explore more network technologies
