In this paper, the authors design a new X100 query engine for the MonetDB system, which combines the advantages of volcano and materialization execution architecture. The new query engine can process a vector of tuples at a time, it can get lower intermediate overload and higher instructions per cycle. Meanwhile, it can overcome the I/O bandwidth problem, making it also suitable for low-power environments.

- **Strengths**: Design a new vectorwise query engine to accelerate query execution process and decrease intermediate overhead.

- **Future works**: Vectorize more query processing operators, and can integrate with advanced buffer manager and query optimizer.
